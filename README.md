## Introduction

This is my submission for the Memory Game project.  This is based on Bootstrap 4 Beta and jQuery.  The game is responsive and should work on mobile and desktop devices.

## Instructions

When the page loads, a new game is automatically started.  Click on cards to "flip" them over.  The game ends when all of the cards are matched.

## Restarting

The reset button in the top right hand corner will reset the game at anytime.  Alternatively, when you finish the game, a reset button will appear in the popup window.

## Issues

The screen will dynamically resize to fit viewer height and width; however, there is limited vertical height adjustment and cards may overflow off bottom of screen on windows that are too short.
